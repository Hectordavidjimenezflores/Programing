# Final Project Report
## Word search

For this project I am going to do a program in c language that generates a wordsearch game that creates an puzzle of letters with different hidden words and the player need to find them, in this game of wordsearch the topic is precious gems and you only have five opportunities to complete the game, for every word you miss you will lose an opportunity to complete the game and also you will lose 100 points in the score, for every word that the player finds he/she will still lose an opportunity but the player will gain 100 points in the score, the mission is to score 500 points or find five words. There is a menu of options, one option asks the player if he/she wants to play the game, another option tells the player the instructions of the game, the third option is the score, and finally the fourth option closes the game. Inside the program I use a two-dimension array to make the wordsearch, I used the “tolower” command so every word that the player inputs will be in lower case, this is to prevent errors from words written in upper case. Finaly the player needs to exit the game (select the option 4) to close the program and run it again if the player wants to play again.

## How to use the program

### Option 1

In this option the player will start playing on the word search.

The words to search are:

1. rubi
2. onyx
3. opalo
4. diamante
5. alejandrina

Correct word +100 pts and incorrect word -100 pts. The player only has five chances to find the five words.

### Option 2

In this option the instructions of the game are explained.

### Option 3

You are shown the score of the game you played.

### Option 4

This option is used to exit the game and close the program. Please choose option 4 before playing again to close the program and run it again.

This program was carried out with what was learned in the structured programming class, in addition I used the following videos as a support to give me an idea of how to structured the mentioned program:
