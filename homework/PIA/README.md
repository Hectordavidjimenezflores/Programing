# Final Project Report
## Word search

For this project I am going to do a program in c language that generates a word search game that creates an puzzle of letters with different hidden words and the player need to find them, in this game of word search the topic is precious gems and you only have five opportunities to complete the game, for every word you miss you will lose an opportunity to complete the game and also you will lose 100 points in the score and if the player writes a word that he/she already found the player would also lose 100 points, for every word that the player finds he/she will still lose an opportunity but the player will gain 100 points in the score, the mission is to score 500 points or find five words. There is a menu of options, one option asks the player if he/she wants to play the game, the second option tells the player the instructions of the game, the third option is the score, and finally the fourth option closes the game. Inside the program I use a two-dimension array to make the word search, I used the “tolower” command so every word that the player inputs will be in lower case, this is to prevent errors from words written in upper case. Finally the player needs to exit the game (select the option 4) to close the program and run it again if the player wants to play again.

## How to use the program

### Option 1

Type the number 1 and click enter to execute the option.

In this option the player will start playing on the word search.

The words to search are:

1. rubi
2. onyx
3. opalo
4. diamante
5. alejandrina

Correct word +100 pts and incorrect word -100 pts. The player only has five chances to find the five words.

### Option 2

Type the number 2 and click enter to execute the option.

In this option the instructions of the game are explained.

### Option 3

Type the number 3 and click enter to execute the option.

You are shown the score of the game you played.

### Option 4

Type the number 4 and click enter to execute the option.

This option is used to exit the game and close the program. Please choose option 4 before playing again to close the program and run it again.

This program was carried out with what was learned in the structured programming class, in addition I used the following videos as a support to give me an idea of how to structured the mentioned program:

- [Second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiMwyicsPeI)


I also used the following website:

And the c-refcard.pdf with which I rely to detect and write the correct syntax of the comands used in this program.

## Special thanks

I would like to thank my teacher Satu Elisa Schaeffer for teaching me many things about programming and also for the recommendation of the book Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie - The C Programming Language, Second Edition (1988) and the c-refcard.
